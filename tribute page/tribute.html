                Sarkar writes that the letters written by Ram Singh's officers from his camp during this period have been preserved among the archives of the Jaipur State. They are all written in the Dingal dialect or the Rajasthani variety of Hindi. 

                Sarkar admits that "The historian who digs down to the root causes of great events, cannot help feeling that Shivaji's visit to Aurangzib produced as its ultimate consequence a revolution in the destiny of the Maratha people. This event marks a decisive turning-point in the history of India as a whole."
                
                Historians have reconstructed the true story of this visit, the plots and counter-plots about him in the imperial Court circle, and the daily changes in the policy of Aurangzib himself, from the most authentic contemporary records.
                
                After attending Aurangzeb's birthday celebrations, right in front of the Mughal emperor, Shivaji Maharaj threw away the robes of welcome and stormed out of the Darbar. A Mughal mansab-dar (holding the rank of a nobleman) of Rajput lineage Jaswant Singh defeated by Shivaji Maharaj in 1664 stood before him at the function and an outraged Maratha king walked out in anger.
                
                So it was decided by the king's inner Council to either kill Shivaji Maharaj or confine him to a fortress. Shivaji Maharaj had his followers all sent back to his home state.

                                <strong>Being now freed from the anxiety about his followers Shivaji set about plans for his own escape. He feigned illness and began to send out of his house every evening sweetmeats for Brahmans, religious mendicants and courtiers. These were carried in huge baskets each slung from a pole which was borne by two men on their shoulders.

                                    The guards searched the baskets for some days and then began to let them pass out unchallenged. This was the opportunity for which Shivaji Maharaj had been waiting. 
                                <br><br>
                                In the afternoon of 19th August 1966, he sent word to his guards that he was very ill and had taken to his bed and that they should not disturb him. His half-brother Hiroji Farzand, who looked somewhat like him, lay down on his cot, with a quilt covering all of his body except the outstretched right arm adorned with Shivaji's gold wristlet, - while Shivaji and his son crouched down in two baskets, which were safely sent out shortly after sunset through the lines of unsuspecting guards, being preceded and followed by baskets of real sweets.The boxes reached the outskirts of Agra, in a jungle. There a trusted general of Shivaji awaited his arrival. Then the king, the son and a few others smeared ashes over their bodies like sadhus and headed towards Mathura. 

                                The next afternoon, Hiroji Farzand walked out as himself along with a trusted aid who was seen pressing Shivaji's Maharaj (the decoy)'s feet the earlier evening, warning the guards to not disturb Maharaj till he returned. 
                                
                                After a while, the guards got suspicious of the silence in the camp and discovered to their horror that the bird had flown away.
                                <br><br>
                                Shivaji's escape from captivity caused lifelong regret for Aurangzeb. As the emperor wrote in his last will and testament, "The greatest pillar of a Government is the keeping of information about everything that happens in the kingdom, - while even a minute's negligence results in shame for long years. See, how the flight of the wretch Shiva, which was due to carelessness, has now involved me in all these distracting campaigns to the end of my days."

                                It may be noteworthy here to mention that Aurangzeb then went with an army himself to the Deccan and lodged himself there for 27 years in a mission to catch Shivaji Maharaj. He failed in that and died a disheartened man in Khultabad, near Aurangabad in Maharashtra. 

                                Shivaji Maharaj is often cited by noted historians as the biggest cause of the weakening of the Mughal empire which was later further destroyed by his descendants and the Peshwa lineage rulers.

If it is a temple, the balls are rung in yearning for Him alone."
